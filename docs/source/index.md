# Uprate

Thanks for giving our docs a try! we will try to make this easy to understand.
If you cannot understand certain parts of the docs or feel that it is too complicated
then feel free to ask [questions here ðŸ˜„](https://github.com/WizzyGeek/uprate/discussions/categories/q-a)

## Quickstart

Docs are currently in the making, unfortunately an API Reference is all we offer right now
but that's devoid of all and any examples.

## Example
(index-example)=
```{literalinclude} examples/docs_index.py
    :language: py
```

we are working on more examples as of now to complete the docs ðŸ˜… stay tuned!
