# About

Uprate is a robust, simple ratelimit library.<br/>
While providing a simple to use api, it is also highly scalable
and provides absolute control for fine-tuning.<br/> Hence, Uprate
can be used in all stages of your app from prototyping to production! ðŸš€
<br/>
[Here](#example) is a simple example.

## Why?

There are two ways ratelimits are implemented in python for server-side
 - Make everything from scratch
 - Use a framework dependent ratelimit library.

The problem in the first way is obvious, it's harder, consumes more time.<br/>
Using a framework dependent ratelimit library is more feasible, but often
these libraries don't provide features like external stores, multiple ratelimits
and manual key specification. While there are some awesome ratelimit libraries for
framwork X, not everyone uses framework X ðŸ˜•.

Ratelimits in client-sided coded also face similar problems. Often APIs enforce multiple
ratelimits which are dynamic. Making a dynamic ratelimiter from scratch for your API wrapper
or a small scale data collector takes up valuable dev time, which is why uprate aims to also 
provide tools for client-sided code

# Getting Started

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version from pypi by
```
pip install uprate
```
*or* you can install the dev version from github
```
pip install git+https://github.com/WizzyGeek/uprate.git@master#egg=uprate
```
## Usage

```
import uprate
```

And you are good to go! ðŸ¤˜

## Example

Here is a simple example that demonstrates Uprate's Awesomeness.

```py
import uprate

@uprate.ratelimit(1 / (uprate.Seconds(2) + uprate.Minutes(1)))
def limited():
    ...

limited()

try:
    # Within 62 seconds
    limited()
except uprate.RateLimitError:
    print("called function too fast")
```

And **so much more**!
